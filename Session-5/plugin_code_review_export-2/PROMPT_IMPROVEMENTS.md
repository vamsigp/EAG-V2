# Prompt Improvements for Structured LLM Reasoning

## Overview
The original prompts in `buildPrompt()` were basic and didn't follow structured reasoning principles. This document outlines the improvements made to satisfy all criteria from `prompt_of_prompts.md`.

## Criteria Analysis & Improvements

### ✅ 1. Explicit Reasoning Instructions
**Before:** Simple task descriptions like "Review this code for style"
**After:** 
- Added explicit 4-phase reasoning approach: REASONING → ANALYSIS → VERIFICATION → OUTPUT
- Instructions to "Think step-by-step about your analysis approach"
- Required analysis steps enumeration in JSON output

### ✅ 2. Structured Output Format
**Before:** Just "Markdown" format requirement
**After:**
- Enforced JSON + Markdown dual format
- Structured JSON schema with required fields:
  ```json
  {
    "reasoning_type": "...",
    "confidence_level": "...", 
    "analysis_steps": [...],
    "findings": {...},
    "verification_notes": "...",
    "limitations": "..."
  }
  ```

### ✅ 3. Separation of Reasoning and Tools
**Before:** Mixed analysis instructions
**After:**
- Clear separation of phases: REASONING → ANALYSIS → VERIFICATION → OUTPUT
- Distinct sections for different types of analysis (logical, pattern recognition, etc.)
- Verification phase explicitly separated from analysis

### ✅ 4. Conversation Loop Support  
**Before:** Single-shot prompts
**After:**
- Structured JSON output enables easy parsing for multi-turn conversations
- Confidence levels and limitations allow for follow-up questions
- Analysis steps can be referenced and built upon

### ✅ 5. Instructional Framing
**Before:** Minimal examples
**After:**
- Detailed task-specific analysis approaches
- Step-by-step methodology for each review type
- Clear formatting examples and requirements
- Verification checklists for self-guidance

### ✅ 6. Internal Self-Checks
**Before:** No validation requirements
**After:**
- Required "VERIFICATION PHASE" in all prompts
- Task-specific verification checklists:
  - Style: "Are suggestions actionable and specific?"
  - Bugs: "Can I reproduce each identified issue?"
  - Tests: "Do tests cover all major code paths?"
  - Summary: "Does my summary accurately reflect the code?"
- Required "verification_notes" field in JSON output

### ✅ 7. Reasoning Type Awareness
**Before:** Generic analysis
**After:**
- Required "reasoning_type" field in JSON (logical_analysis, pattern_recognition, risk_assessment, etc.)
- Task-specific reasoning approaches defined
- Explicit categorization of analysis methodology

### ✅ 8. Error Handling or Fallbacks
**Before:** No error handling
**After:**
- Required "confidence_level" field (high/medium/low)
- Required "limitations" field for uncertainties
- Explicit instruction: "If you encounter any uncertainties or limitations, clearly state them"
- Fallback parsing in `parseStructuredResponse()` function

### ✅ 9. Overall Clarity and Robustness
**Before:** Vague, short prompts prone to hallucination
**After:**
- Comprehensive, structured prompts with clear expectations
- Consistent format across all review types
- Self-verification requirements reduce drift
- Structured output enables validation and quality checks

## Technical Implementation

### New Functions Added:
1. **`parseStructuredResponse()`** - Handles JSON + Markdown parsing with fallbacks
2. **`getConfidenceColor()`** - Visual confidence indicators in UI
3. **Enhanced response processing** - Uses structured data for better UI display

### UI Enhancements:
- Confidence level indicators with color coding
- Limitations/warnings prominently displayed
- Analysis type metadata shown
- Structured data preserved for export functions

## Benefits Achieved:

1. **Reduced Hallucination** - Self-verification and structured requirements
2. **Better Consistency** - Standardized analysis methodology  
3. **Improved Quality** - Confidence levels and limitation awareness
4. **Enhanced Debugging** - Structured reasoning steps visible
5. **Future-Proof** - Easy to extend with new reasoning requirements
6. **Better UX** - Users can see analysis confidence and limitations

## Example Output Structure:
```
[Confidence/Analysis Type Header]
↓
[Detailed Markdown Analysis]
↓  
[JSON Metadata for Processing]
```

This approach transforms simple code review requests into sophisticated, step-by-step reasoning processes that produce more reliable and transparent results.
