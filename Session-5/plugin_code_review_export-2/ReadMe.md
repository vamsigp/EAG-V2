# Gemini Code Review Chrome Extension

This extension allows you to perform AI-powered code reviews on GitHub files using the Gemini API. It provides style review, bug analysis, test suggestions, and a summary for supported code files.

## Recent Changes (September 2025)

### Background Script for API Requests
- **All Gemini API requests are now made from a background script (`background.js`) instead of directly from the content script.**
- This change allows you to inspect all network requests and responses in the Chrome Extension's Service Worker DevTools (chrome://extensions > Inspect Service Worker).
- The content script sends a message to the background script, which performs the actual fetch to the Gemini API and returns the result.
- This is the recommended pattern for Chrome Manifest V3 extensions, as it improves security, debuggability, and transparency.

### How It Works
- When you click "Review with Gemini", the content script sends a message to the background script for each review type (style, bugs, tests, summary).
- The background script makes the POST request to the Gemini API and returns the response to the content script.
- You will see two network requests per review in DevTools: an OPTIONS (pre-flight) and a POST (actual API call). Only the POST counts against your Gemini API quota.

### Inspecting Requests
- Open chrome://extensions, find this extension, and click "Service Worker" under Inspect views.
- Use the Network tab to see all Gemini API requests and responses, including payloads and errors.

### Files Added/Changed
- **background.js**: Handles all Gemini API requests and message passing.
- **manifest.json**: Registers the background script as a service worker.
- **content-script.js**: Now uses `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` to request reviews from the background script.
