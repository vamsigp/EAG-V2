# Enhanced SCRA (Structured Code Review Agent) Prompt System

## 🎯 Overview
The prompt system has been upgraded with the **Structured Code Review Agent (SCRA)** framework, transforming basic code review requests into rigorous, tool-assisted analysis with explicit reasoning chains.

## 🛠️ Key Enhancements

### 1. **Agent Identity & Role Definition**
```
You are the **Structured Code Review Agent (SCRA)**, a Senior Software Engineer
```
- Clear professional identity establishes expertise context
- Sets expectations for depth and quality of analysis

### 2. **Conceptual Tool Framework**
```
🛠️ Conceptual Tools (Must be referenced in ACTION field)
* linter_check(ruleset): Simulates running a local linter or style checker
* security_scan(focus_area): Simulates vulnerability scanning
* dependency_lookup(package_name): Simulates dependency analysis
* performance_analysis(metric): Simulates performance profiling
* test_coverage_check(scope): Simulates coverage analysis
```

**Benefits:**
- Provides structured approach to different types of analysis
- Forces explicit mention of analysis methodology
- Enables verification of tool usage in responses
- Creates consistency across different review types

### 3. **Enhanced JSON Schema**
```json
{
  "turn_context": "Conversation awareness for multi-turn support",
  "reasoning_type": "Explicit categorization of analysis approach",
  "confidence_level": "Self-assessment of analysis quality",
  "analysis_plan": "Step-by-step methodology outline",
  "findings": [
    {
      "REASONING_TYPE": "Specific finding category",
      "THOUGHT": "Explicit reasoning chain (CoT)",
      "ACTION": "Tool used for verification",
      "TOOL_ERROR": "Error handling for failed tools",
      "ISSUE_DETAIL": {
        "line_ref": "Precise location reference",
        "severity": "Risk assessment",
        "fix_suggestion": "Actionable solution"
      }
    }
  ],
  "verification_notes": "Self-check summary",
  "limitations": "Uncertainty acknowledgment"
}
```

### 4. **Task-Specific Enhancements**

#### Style Analysis (🎨)
- **Focus**: Code_Style findings with linter_check tools
- **Reasoning**: Adherence to language conventions and readability
- **Verification**: Against official style guides

#### Bug Analysis (🐛)  
- **Focus**: Bug_Logic and Security findings
- **Tools**: security_scan, error pattern detection
- **Reasoning**: Execution path analysis and vulnerability assessment

#### Test Strategy (🧪)
- **Focus**: Testing findings with coverage analysis
- **Tools**: test_coverage_check, framework analysis  
- **Reasoning**: Comprehensive testing strategy design

#### Summary Analysis (📋)
- **Focus**: Architecture findings with complexity analysis
- **Tools**: dependency_lookup, design pattern detection
- **Reasoning**: Architectural and functional comprehension

## 🎨 UI Enhancements

### Visual Indicators
- **Confidence Levels**: Color-coded (High=Green, Medium=Orange, Low=Red)
- **Severity Ratings**: Critical=Red, High=Orange, Medium=Yellow, Low=Green
- **Analysis Metadata**: Shows reasoning type, plan, and tool usage

### Enhanced Findings Display
```
📍 Lines: 42-45
🧠 Analysis: [Explicit reasoning]  
🔧 Tool: linter_check(naming_conventions)
💡 Suggestion: [Actionable fix]
```

### Structured Information Cards
- Analysis plan visualization (step1 → step2 → step3)
- Issue summary with severity counts
- Limitations prominently displayed

## 🔍 Criteria Satisfaction Analysis

✅ **Explicit Reasoning**: THOUGHT field mandates explicit reasoning chains  
✅ **Structured Output**: Strict JSON + Markdown format enforced  
✅ **Tool Separation**: ACTION field separates reasoning from tool usage  
✅ **Conversation Loop**: turn_context enables multi-turn conversations  
✅ **Instructional Framing**: Task-specific methodologies and examples  
✅ **Self-Checks**: verification_notes field requires self-validation  
✅ **Reasoning Awareness**: REASONING_TYPE categorizes analysis approach  
✅ **Error Handling**: TOOL_ERROR field handles failed analysis tools  
✅ **Overall Clarity**: Comprehensive, consistent framework across all tabs

## 🚀 Benefits Achieved

### For Users:
1. **Transparency**: See exactly how AI analyzed the code
2. **Confidence**: Know the reliability level of each finding
3. **Actionability**: Get specific, implementable suggestions
4. **Context**: Understand limitations and uncertainties

### For AI Analysis:
1. **Consistency**: Standardized approach across all review types
2. **Verifiability**: Tool usage creates audit trail
3. **Quality**: Self-verification reduces hallucinations
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new tools and reasoning types

### For Development Teams:
1. **Integration**: Structured JSON enables automation
2. **Prioritization**: Severity levels help focus efforts
3. **Learning**: Explicit reasoning helps junior developers
4. **Documentation**: Analysis becomes part of code documentation

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

1. **Tool Expansion**: Add more conceptual tools (complexity_analysis, architecture_scan)
2. **Custom Rulesets**: Allow users to define custom linting rules
3. **Team Integration**: Export findings to issue tracking systems
4. **Historical Analysis**: Track code quality improvements over time
5. **Multi-Language Support**: Expand tool definitions for different languages

The SCRA system transforms code review from subjective commentary into systematic, verifiable analysis with clear reasoning chains and actionable outcomes.
