# Personal History Agent - Final Submission

## Project Overview

This Personal History Agent successfully demonstrates a sophisticated 4-layer cognitive architecture that creates personalized historical reports. The system collects user information through natural conversation, automatically researches historical events and city information, and generates professional PDF reports.

## Architecture Implementation

The agent implements a clean 4-layer cognitive architecture with proper separation of concerns:

1. **Perception Layer** (`perception.py`) - Google Gemini AI with structured Chain-of-Thought JSON prompting
2. **Memory Layer** (`memory.py`) - Session state management, user profiles, and research data persistence  
3. **Decision-Making Layer** (`decision_making.py`) - Intelligent workflow orchestration with loop detection
4. **Action Layer** (`action.py`) - Tool execution, research, PDF generation, and user interaction

## Key Technical Achievements

### ✅ Stage Transition Management
- **Problem Solved**: Fixed timing issues where stage transitions happened prematurely during user input processing
- **Solution**: Removed inappropriate auto-transitions from memory layer, implemented proper action-driven transitions
- **Result**: Seamless workflow progression from USER_INFO_COLLECTION → HISTORICAL_RESEARCH → PRESENTATION → DELIVERY_EXECUTION

### ✅ Enhanced Loop Detection  
- **Problem Solved**: False positive loop detection was interrupting normal multi-step data collection
- **Solution**: Made loop detection argument-aware to distinguish between different field collections
- **Result**: System properly handles repeated `gather_user_info` calls for name, birth_date, and favorite_city

### ✅ Rich Research Content
- **Problem Solved**: PDF content was showing generic placeholder text instead of detailed research
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive historical databases with real events and city information
- **Result**: PDFs now contain detailed historical facts like "Bastille Day - French National Day (1789)" with rich context

### ✅ End-to-End Workflow
- **Achievement**: Complete user journey works seamlessly without manual intervention or workflow interruption
- **Features**: Natural conversation flow, automatic research triggering, professional PDF generation
- **Output**: Generated PDFs saved to ~/Downloads with actual personalized historical content

## Core Structured Prompt

```
You are a Personal History Assistant with a 4-layer cognitive architecture.

Your goal: Create personalized historical reports by collecting user information, researching historical events, and delivering reports.

You operate through 4 distinct layers:
1. **Perception** (You): LLM reasoning and natural language processing
2. **Memory**: State management and data persistence  
3. **Decision-Making**: Workflow orchestration and validation
4. **Action**: Tool execution and user interaction

## Final LLM Prompt Structure

The Perception Layer uses this structured prompt with Google Gemini AI:

```
You are a Personal History Assistant with a 4-layer cognitive architecture.

Your goal: Create personalized historical reports by collecting EXACTLY 3 pieces of user information, researching historical events, and delivering reports.

CRITICAL: Only collect these 3 fields - DO NOT ask for additional information:
1. Name (first name or full name)
2. Birth date (DD/MM format - do NOT ask for year)
3. Favorite city (city name only)

STRUCTURED REASONING FORMAT:
You MUST respond in this exact format:

```json
{
  "THOUGHT": "Your chain-of-thought reasoning about the current situation and what needs to be done",
  "ACTION": {
    "FUNCTION_CALL": {
      "tool_name": "[gather_user_info | research_historical_events | research_city_info | generate_pdf | send_email]",
      "arguments": {...},
      "reasoning_type": "[COLLECTION | LOOKUP | VALIDATION | DECISION | EXECUTION | COMMUNICATION]",
      "current_stage": "[USER_INFO_COLLECTION | HISTORICAL_RESEARCH | PRESENTATION | DELIVERY_EXECUTION]"
    }
  }
}
```

OR for user responses:

```json
{
  "THOUGHT": "Your reasoning about what to say to the user",
  "ACTION": {
    "USER_RESPONSE": {
      "message": "Your message to the user",
      "expecting": "what_input_you_expect",
      "reasoning_type": "[COLLECTION | COMMUNICATION]",
      "current_stage": "current workflow stage"
    }
  }
}
```

WORKFLOW STAGES:
1. **USER_INFO_COLLECTION**: Collect name, birth date, favorite city
2. **HISTORICAL_RESEARCH**: Research events and city information  
3. **PRESENTATION**: Present findings to user
4. **DELIVERY_EXECUTION**: Generate PDF or send email

AVAILABLE TOOLS:

### 1. gather_user_info

### Layer Integration Flow

```
User Input → Perception Layer (LLM) → Decision-Making Layer → Action Layer → Memory Layer
                     ↑                                                              ↓
                     └──────────── Feedback Loop ←─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Features

- **Structured CoT-JSON Prompting**: Every LLM response includes explicit reasoning (THOUGHT) and structured actions
- **Stage-Based Workflow**: Automatic progression through collection → research → presentation → delivery
- **Loop Detection**: Prevents infinite conversation loops with automatic recovery
- **Auto-Flow Management**: Seamless transitions without user confusion
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures and user input errors

### Reasoning Types

- **COLLECTION**: Gathering user information
- **LOOKUP**: Researching historical data
- **VALIDATION**: Checking data completeness and format
- **DECISION**: Workflow routing and stage transitions
- **EXECUTION**: Tool execution and file operations
- **COMMUNICATION**: User interaction and responses

### Stage Transitions

1. **USER_INFO_COLLECTION** → **HISTORICAL_RESEARCH**: When name, birth_date, and favorite_city are collected
2. **HISTORICAL_RESEARCH** → **PRESENTATION**: When both historical events and city information are researched
3. **PRESENTATION** → **DELIVERY_EXECUTION**: When user chooses delivery method (PDF/email)
4. **DELIVERY_EXECUTION** → **COMPLETED**: When report is successfully generated/sent

### Error Recovery Mechanisms

- **Perception Errors**: Fallback to stage-appropriate prompts
- **Validation Errors**: Clear guidance for correct input format
- **Loop Detection**: Automatic intervention with alternative actions
- **Tool Failures**: Graceful degradation with user notification
