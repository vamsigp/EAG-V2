# Note: Placeholder for icon16.png
# This file represents a 16x16 pixel icon with a search/magnifying glass symbol
# You'll need to create an actual PNG file for the extension to work

# To create the icons, you can:
# 1. Use any image editor (GIMP, Photoshop, online tools)
# 2. Create a 16x16 PNG with a magnifying glass icon
# 3. Use a gradient background from #667eea to #764ba2
# 4. Add a white magnifying glass symbol

# Alternatively, you can use placeholder colored squares:
# - Make a 16x16 blue square and save as icon16.png
# - Make a 48x48 blue square and save as icon48.png  
# - Make a 128x128 blue square and save as icon128.png
